Isabella Lee, Sophia Gao, Lucian Li, Lin Huang

For our final project, we have created a mobile application catered towards beginner hikers at UCLA, with the aim to facilitate more involvement with nature through increasing awareness of outdoor activities. 

The final deliverables are located in the 'final' folder, and other project files for previous assignments are located in the corresponding folder.
